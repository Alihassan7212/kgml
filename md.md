## **Ali Hassan Bhatti: Profile for PhD in Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning for Optimization Problems**

**Deakin-Coventry Cotutelle Program**

### **1\. Introduction**

This document outlines the strong alignment of Ali Hassan Bhatti's academic background, research experience, and technical skills with the requirements of the Deakin-Coventry Cotutelle PhD program in "Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning for Optimization Problems." His profile demonstrates a robust foundation in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and complex problem-solving, making him a highly suitable candidate for this research endeavor.

### **2\. Direct Alignment with Research Focus: Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning & Optimization**

While the term "Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning" (KGML) might not be explicitly stated in all project titles, Ali Hassan's work demonstrates a clear trajectory towards integrating intelligent control and learning with domain-specific challenges, which is the essence of KGML.

* **MSc Thesis: "Reinforcement Learning based thermal comfort Controller"**: This project inherently involves creating an ML model (Reinforcement Learning) that learns to optimize a specific real-world problem (thermal comfort). The "knowledge" aspect comes from understanding the thermal dynamics of a building, sensor data interpretation, and the desired comfort parameters, all of which guide the RL agent's learning process and reward structure. This is a practical application of ML for optimization with implicit domain knowledge.  
* **Visiting Researcher at Coventry University**: Designing an "reinforcement learning-based controller for home energy optimization" is directly relevant. Energy optimization is a classic optimization problem. Using RL implies learning optimal control strategies. The "extensive research using available datasets of domestic energy consumption" and development of a "hardware prototype" shows an understanding of applying ML to real-world data and constraints, a key aspect of KGML. This experience at Coventry is particularly pertinent to the cotutelle program.  
* **Personal Project: "Design of Reinforcement learning based HVAC controller for residential building/house"**: Further reinforces his focus on applying RL to optimize complex systems, a theme central to the PhD.

These experiences showcase an ability to apply advanced machine learning techniques to solve optimization problems in practical settings, where understanding the system's constraints and goals (domain knowledge) is crucial for success.
